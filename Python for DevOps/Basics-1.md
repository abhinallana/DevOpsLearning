#Variables and Naming Conventions

```¶
General guidelines on how to name your identifiers -

Module-> lowercase
Class -> CapWords
Functions -> lowercase
Methods -> lowercase
Constants -> UPPERCASE
Package -> lowercase
Avoid the usage of 'l', 'O' or 'I' as a single variable name: these characters look similar to zero (0) and (1) in some fonts. ```
